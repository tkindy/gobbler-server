==============
GOBBLER SERVER
==============

The Single Player Game
--------
The Gobbler game is a thanksgiving-themed game where the player controls a
turkey and attempts to eat all on-screen food before any number of NPC turkeys
can get to it before the timer runs out. The player controls their own turkey
with a mouse, clicking on the screen to create 'waypoints' to which their turkey
will travel.


The Multi-player Game
--------
The multiplayer game will have three phases: a waiting phase, a countdown phase,
and a playing phase.

I   Waiting Phase
In this phase, clients are waiting for enough players to join the game for it to
run. Clients will receive a WaitingMessage (defined below) when they join and
then whenever there are any changes.

II  Countdown Phase
In this phase, there have been enough players to run the game. Exactly enough
players waiting to play are selected, and the initial state is sent to clients,
along with how long is left in the countdown. This CountdownMessage is sent on
each clock tick. This phase ends at the end of the countdown.

III Playing Phase
This phase, to a player, will operate much like the single-player game, the only
change being that what was once NPCs are now being controlled by other players.
To clients, the changes are more substantial. On each clock tick, the server
will calculate the next state and send it to the clients. When a client detects
a change in waypoint, it will send this information to the server. As foods are
eaten, new ones will appear. The game ends when the time runs out.
At the end of the game, a GameOverMessage is sent to clients, the clients that
just played are put into the end of the waiting list, and the game returns to
the waiting phase.

If at any point a new client connects, that world is added to the end of a
waiting list.
